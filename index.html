          <p>New Christians often wonder, “How can I know for certain I am really saved? Is my salvation based on the way I feel? Is there any chance I could lose my salvation if I sin? How can I be certain I am a child of God?</p> 
          <p>”When we consider questions such as these, it is good to know that the Bible says we can know that we are saved.</p>
          <div class="verse"><p>“These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life” <p>-1 John 5:13</p></div>
          <p>Did you notice the word “know”? It means we can be absolutely certain that we are saved. But how can we know?</p>
          <h3>You Know You’re Saved Because
the Bible Says So.</h4> <p>The Bible is God’s Word. God is holy and perfect and cannot lie. Consequently, every word in God’s Word, the Bible, is true. When it comes to the subject of being saved, the Bible clearly states that <span>Whoever repents of his/her sin, believes in the Lord Jesus, and Confesses that Jesus is his/her Lord, has the gift of salvation.</span> The apostle John affirmed this when he said, 
          <div class="verse"><p>“But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name”</p> <p> -John 1:12</p></div>. Jesus Himself taught this when He said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life” (John 6:47). Likewise, the apostle Paul said, <div class="verse"><p>“For ‘Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved"</p> <p>-Romans 10:13</p></div>
          <p>The Bible teaches that if you have sincerely done these things, you are indeed saved!</p>

          <section class="main-section" id="Is_Baptism_Important?">
          <header><h1>Is Baptism Important?</h1>Baptism is for Those Who Have
Already Believed in Jesus. <p> In the New Testament, only those who had already accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior were baptized (Acts 2:41, 8:12, 8:38, 9:18, 10:48 16:15, 16:33, 18:8, 19:5). Babies were never baptized. The reason infant baptism is not mentioned in the New Testament is because baptism is for believers only, and babies cannot believe!</p> <p>If you were sprinkled as a baby (or immersed for that matter), you have not been scripturally baptized. Also, if you were baptized before you were saved (when you were a nonbeliever), you have not been scripturally baptized. Biblical baptism is believer’s baptism.</p>
          <p>Baptism is by Immersion.
The word “baptize” means “to immerse, plunge, or dip.” By definition, baptism by immersion was the exclusive mode of baptism practiced in New Testament times. When Philip baptized the eunuch from Ethiopia, the Bible says, <div class="verse"><p>“And he ordered the chariot to stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch, and he baptized him. When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch no longer saw him, but went on his way rejoicing”</p> <p>-Acts 8:38–39</p></div>. It is clear that the eunuch was baptized by immersion. Why? Because immersion is the only mode of baptism that is capable of visually portraying the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus (cf. Romans 6:3–4). Anyone who has merely been “sprinkled” has not been scripturally baptized. You should be baptized the only way the New Testament affirms—by immersion.</p> 
          <p>Baptism is a Symbol of Salvation. Salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. It is a gift of God that no one can earn or merit. We are not saved by participating in either of the two Christian ordinances: baptism or the Lord’s Supper. A person is not baptized to be saved. He/she is baptized because he /she is already saved. If a non-Christian is immersed in water, he will come out of that water just as he/she went in—lost and unsaved. Water does not save—the blood of Jesus does. Paul was saved because he called on the name of the Lord, not because he/she was baptized (Acts 22:16).</p> <p>If you have been baptized in a church that teaches that baptism in some way saves you, you have not been scripturally baptized. You should follow the Lord in New Testament baptism as a symbol of your salvation.</p>

          <header><h1>How Do I Pray?</h1>
            <p>Prayer is honestly conversing and intimately communing with God. It is not merely talking to God but also talking with Him. It is a two-way conversation—a dialogue, not a monologue.</p> <h3>How can we talk with God?</h3> We Must Learn to Listen to God. God speaks to us in several ways. The primary way is through the Bible. After all, it is God’s Word. As we spend time reading and learning the biblical text, the Holy Spirit who inspired it will begin to use it to change the way we think about life. We will begin to think biblically. We will learn that if we do what God’s Word tells us, we will be blessed by Him.</p>
<p> God also speaks to us as Christians through the promptings of the Holy Spirit who dwells within us. Once you give your life to Jesus, you begin to have desires that you have never had before—desires to share the Gospel with non-Christians; to help needy people financially; to perform acts of kindness, sometimes to total strangers.</p> <p>Those desires are simply the promptings of the Spirit of God within you. He is the One leading us to reach out to be a blessing to others. When we have those promptings, we must obey Him, he will lead you to the place of destiny. He will continue to speak to us and guide us in service to others. You and I can remain in a constant state of prayer as we walk in the Spirit (Galatians 5:16, 25), listening to His still, small voice. We Must Learn to Talk to God. Prayer is also talking to God. He wants us to come to Him as a child comes to a loving father.</p><div class="verse"><p>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</p><p>-Matthew 6:9</p></p>

          <section class="main-section" id="How_Do_I_read_the_Bible?">
            <header><h1>How Do I read the Bible?</h1>
            <p>The Bible is the inspired Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16). It not only contains truth; it is truth (John 17:17). The very words of Scripture (not merely the ideas behind the words) are inspired and God-breathed. All the words of the Bible are inspired. Every word of the Old and New Testaments, from Genesis 1:1 to Revelation 22:21, is the inspired, inerrant, infallible, and authoritative Word of God.</p>
         <ul><h2>Here’s how you can understand your Bible:</h2>
          <li><h3>Read the Bible.</h3> <p>When you become a Christian, you should begin to systematically read the Scriptures. You do not need to randomly open the Bible and read it haphazardly (i.e. open the Bible and read “wherever”). It is far better to follow some sort of systematic reading plan that calls for the reading of entire books of the Bible from beginning to end. You would do well to begin reading a chapter a day in the New Testament. You could start with the Gospel of Matthew.</p> <p>When that book is completed, go to another book in the New Testament and read it at the same pace (a chapter per day) until the entire New Testament is completed. After that, you might want to read the entire Bible through in a year’s time. Reading the Bible slowly allows the meaning of the text to soak in. Likewise, reading the Bible out loud helps concentration and prevents mental wandering.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Study the Bible.</h3>
<p>There are a number of ways to study the Bible. One is to look up cross references that are referred to in the margin of your Bible. These additional verses will shed insight into the meaning of the text you are studying at that time. There are also excellent theologically conservative Bible commentaries that can offer valuable information by explaining the meaning of the biblical text.</p> <p>Also, you would be well advised to join a weekly Bible study with a mature believer teaching the Word of God.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Hear the Bible Preached/Taught.</h3>
You should join a church that has a pastor who preaches and teaches the Bible on a regular basis. As you listen to sermons, take notes and study them in more depth after the sermon is delivered. You should also join a small group, such as a Sunday school class, that provides additional study of the Scripture on a regular basis. Hearing God’s Word taught and preached will help build your faith (Romans 10:17) and cause you to become more aware of God’s will for your life.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Memorize Bible Verses.</h3>
            <p>One of the best ways for you to get a better grasp on the meaning of Scripture is to memorize Bible verses. It is best to memorize Scripture from the same Bible version you regularly read from.</p> <p>Try writing out a verse of Scripture you desire to commit to memory on a blank business card. Carry your memory verse(s) with you throughout the day. Consider memorizing one or two verses a week and reviewing each verse daily for six weeks while you continue to add new verses. After six weeks, review those original verses once a week for the next six months. Then, review them once a month for the next two years. Soon, they will be yours for life!</p></li>
            <li><h3>Sing the Bible.</h3>
            <p>You should sing “Scripture songs.” There are many Christian hymns and choruses that use entire verses of Scripture for their text.</p> <p>Singing Scripture has helped children memorize Scripture for years, and it works for adults as well! Listen to music that is based on the Word of God.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Meditate on the Bible.</h3>
            <p>You should meditate on the Scriptures you have read, heard, studied, memorized, sung, and displayed. As you mull over God’s Word again and again, the Holy Spirit will unlock the truths of the text and guide you into all truth (John 16:13).</p></li>
            <li><h3>Display the Bible</h3>
            <p>Christian artists have provided us with the opportunity to display beautiful pictures with Scripture verses written on them in our homes and offices, on our screens, displays e.t.c.</p> <p>Why not display at least one such picture with a verse of Scripture in every room of your house? Over the years, these verses will serve as a silent, yet constant reminder of the truths of God’s powerful Word!</p></li>
            <p>Whoever reads, studies, hears, memorizes, sings, displays, and meditates on the Word of God will definitely <i>“grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 3:18).</i></p>

            <header><h1>Is Church Membership Necessary?</h1>
            <p>The Church is very important because Jesus founded it. The Church is referred to in the New Testament in several ways. Paul called it Jesus’ Building (Ephesians 2:20–21). Jesus is referred to as the Foundation of the Church (1 Corinthians 3:11), the very stabilizing Rock upon which it is built (Matthew 16:18). He is also called the Church’s Cornerstone (Ephesians 2:20). Paul also speaks of the Church as Jesus’ Body (Ephesians 5:23). Christ is the Head of the Church (Colossians 1:18), and Christians constitute the members of His Body (Ephesians 5:29–30).We function together as a unit under His leadership</p>
            <p>The Church is called Jesus’ Bride (Ephesians 5:26–27). The husband is told to love his wife even as Jesus loves His Bride, the Church, having given His life for Her (Ephesians 5:25). Jesus is married to us by means of salvation. He loves us as a faithful Bridegroom (Mark 2:19–20).</p><p>When you worship the Lord alone (Matthew 6:6) or with a congregation of believers (1 Corinthians 3:16), you are simply ascribing to the Lord how awesome and glorious He is. In doing so, you are imitating the angels who worship the Lord continuously in Heaven (cf. Isaiah 6; Revelation 4). In order for you to grow as God desires, you must worship Him. Worship will attract God’s manifest presence and will also lift the believer to new heights of spiritual growth and maturity. It will prepare you for eternity in Heaven.</p>
            <ul><p>You should only consider joining a
church that believes basic biblical doctrines such as…
<li>The entire Bible is the inspired Word of God.</li>
<li>Jesus is the divine, virgin-born, sinless, sacrificial,
resurrected, returning, and saving Son of God.</li>
<li>Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, and
in Christ alone.</li>
<li>Jesus Christ is the only way to God.</li>
<li>Christians should witness to lost people, so those
who are lost can be saved.</li></ul>
